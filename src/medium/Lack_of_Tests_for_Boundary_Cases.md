# Lack of Tests for Boundary Cases

**Severity**: Medium

## Description

Omitting tests for boundary cases can lead to unhandled conditions, causing potential bugs.

## What should not be done

```rust
fn test() { /* no boundary tests */ }
```

## What Can Be Done Instead

Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios to improve reliability.

```rust
fn test_with_boundary_cases() { /* test edge cases */ }
```
