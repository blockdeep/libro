# Lack of Tests for Boundary Cases

**Severity**: Medium

## Description
Omitting tests for boundary cases can lead to unhandled conditions, causing potential bugs.

## Why It Should Not Be Done


```rust
fn test() { /* no boundary tests */ }
```



## What Can Be Done Instead



```rust
fn test_with_boundary_cases() { /* test edge cases */ }
```
