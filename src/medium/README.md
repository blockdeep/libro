# Medium Severity Issues

## Description

Medium-severity issues are moderate concerns that may impact system efficiency, readability, or maintainability. These
issues do not immediately compromise system security or core functionality but may cause occasional errors, slowdowns,
or increased technical debt if left unchecked.

## Implications

Addressing medium-severity issues helps in optimizing code performance and improving maintainability, especially as the
codebase scales. They should be resolved in a timely manner, as their cumulative impact over time can lead to more
significant technical challenges. Fixing these issues improves developer productivity and code reliability in the long
term.
