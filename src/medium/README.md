# Medium Severity Issues

## Description

Medium-severity issues in context of Polkadot SDK often stem from outdated conventions, insufficient modularity, or inadequate adherence to modern standards. While these issues do not immediately compromise the blockchain's core functionality or security, they can negatively impact runtime performance, maintainability, and metadata quality, which are crucial for efficient interaction with frontends and other ecosystem components. Addressing these issues aligns the runtime with Substrate's best practices, ensuring compatibility with future updates and scalability as the chain evolves.

## Implications

Resolving medium-severity issues in a Substrate runtime improves performance, reduces technical debt, and ensures the runtime's metadata is precise and useful for external tools and developers. By proactively addressing these concerns, developers maintain a clean, scalable codebase that adheres to Substrate's evolving standards and facilitates smoother interactions across the ecosystem.
