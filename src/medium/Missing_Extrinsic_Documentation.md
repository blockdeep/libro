# Missing Extrinsic Documentation

**Severity**: Medium

## Description

A lack of documentation for extrinsics can lead to misunderstandings about their functionality, expected inputs,
permissions, and possible errors. Proper documentation ensures that developers and users understand how to interact with
the extrinsic correctly.

## What should be avoided

Leaving extrinsics undocumented makes it difficult to understand their behavior, which may lead to misuse or unexpected
errors:

```rust
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
pub fn transfer(sender: OriginFor<T>, recipient: AccountId, amount: BalanceOf<T>) {
    // Performs operation with no explanation of parameters, permissions, or errors
}
```

## Best Practice

Document each extrinsic clearly, detailing its purpose, input parameters, permissions, and potential errors to improve
usability and clarity:

```rust
/// Transfers a specified amount from the sender to the recipient.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `sender`: The origin initiating the transfer.
/// - `recipient`: The account ID of the entity receiving the funds.
/// - `amount`: The amount to be transferred.
///
/// # Permissions
/// Only callable by accounts with sufficient balance to cover the `amount`.
///
/// # Errors
/// - `InsufficientBalance` if the sender's balance is too low.
/// - `InvalidRecipient` if the recipient account is invalid.
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
pub fn transfer(sender: OriginFor<T>, recipient: AccountId, amount: BalanceOf<T>) -> DispatchResult {
    // Function implementation here
}
```

In this example:

- Each parameter, required permission, and potential error is clearly documented, ensuring users know exactly how to
  interact with the extrinsic and what conditions to expect.
- This level of detail minimizes confusion and supports safer, more effective use of the extrinsic.
