# Document Extrinsics to Clarify Usage, Permissions, and Error Handling

**Severity**: Medium

## Description

A lack of documentation for extrinsics can lead to misunderstandings about their functionality, expected inputs, permissions, and possible errors. Proper documentation ensures that developers and users understand how to interact with the extrinsic correctly.

## What Should Not Be Done

Leaving extrinsics undocumented makes it difficult to understand their behavior, which may lead to misuse or unexpected errors:

```rust
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
fn some_extrinsic() {
    // Performs operation with no explanation of parameters, permissions, or errors
}
```

## What can be done instead

Document each extrinsic clearly, detailing its purpose, input parameters, permissions, and potential errors to improve usability and clarity:

```rust
/// Transfers a specified amount from the sender to the recipient.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `sender`: The account ID of the entity initiating the transfer.
/// - `recipient`: The account ID of the entity receiving the funds.
/// - `amount`: The amount to be transferred, specified as a `u32`.
///
/// # Permissions
/// Only callable by accounts with sufficient balance to cover the `amount`.
///
/// # Errors
/// - Returns `Error::<T>::InsufficientBalance` if the sender's balance is too low.
/// - Returns `Error::<T>::InvalidRecipient` if the recipient account is invalid.
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
fn transfer(sender: OriginFor<T>, recipient: AccountId, amount: u32) -> DispatchResult {
    // Function implementation here
}
```

In this example:
- Each parameter, required permission, and potential error is clearly documented, ensuring users know exactly how to interact with the extrinsic and what conditions to expect.
- This level of detail minimizes confusion and supports safer, more effective use of the extrinsic.
