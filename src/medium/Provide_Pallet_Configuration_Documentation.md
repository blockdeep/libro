# Provide Pallet Configuration Documentation

**Severity**: <span style="color:gold;">Medium</span>

## Description

Pallet configuration items (types, constants, or associated items within the `Config` trait) define critical customization points for integrating a pallet into a runtime. Proper documentation for these items is essential, as their descriptions are included in the runtime's metadata, which is accessible to frontend developers, runtime integrators, and other tools interacting with the blockchain. Clear documentation helps developers understand the purpose, constraints, and expected usage of configuration items, reducing the risk of misconfigurations. It also enables frontend developers to provide better user experiences by offering contextual information about the runtimeâ€™s configuration. Ensuring thorough documentation promotes clarity, collaboration, and robust integration within the Substrate ecosystem.

## What should be avoided

Leaving pallet configuration items undocumented leads to ambiguity and reduces maintainability:

```rust
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    type Currency: Inspect<Self::AccountId> + Mutate<Self::AccountId>;
    type MaxSize: Get<u32>;
}
```

In this example:

- The `Currency` and `MaxSize` configuration items lack documentation, making their usage unclear to developers
  implementing the pallet.

## Best practice

Document each pallet configuration item with a brief description of its purpose and constraints:

```rust
/// Configuration trait for the pallet.
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    /// The currency mechanism for handling balances in the system.
    type Currency: Inspect<Self::AccountId> + Mutate<Self::AccountId>;

    /// Maximum allowed size for operations in this pallet.
    /// This value must be set according to expected workload and resource limits.
    type MaxSize: Get<u32>;
}
```

Documenting the pallet's configuration has lots of benefits:

1. **Improved Clarity**: Developers implementing the pallet can easily understand the purpose and expected usage of configuration items.
2. **Reduced Misconfigurations**: Clear documentation minimizes the risk of setting inappropriate values or types during runtime configuration.
3. **Better Collaboration**: Well-documented configuration traits facilitate onboarding of new contributors and reduce the learning curve for your codebase.

By ensuring proper documentation for configuration items, you enhance the maintainability, usability, and robustness of your pallet.
