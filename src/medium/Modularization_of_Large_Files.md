# Modularization of Large Files

**Severity**: Medium

## Description

Large files reduce readability and make navigation difficult for developers.

## What should not be done

```rust
// single large file with multiple functions
```

## What Can Be Done Instead

Divide large files into smaller modules for better organization.

```rust
// split functions into smaller modules
```
