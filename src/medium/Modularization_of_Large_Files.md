# Modularization of Large Files

**Severity**: Medium

## Description

Large files with numerous functions and types reduce readability, making it difficult for developers to navigate,
understand, and maintain the code. Modularizing large files into smaller, logically organized modules enhances
readability and simplifies code management.

## What should not be done

A single large file with multiple unrelated functions and types can become hard to work with:

```rust
// lib.rs (single large file with all logic)
fn process_transaction() -> Result<Transaction, Error> { /* transaction processing logic */ }

fn calculate_fees() -> u32 { /* fee calculation logic */ }

fn validate_data() -> Result<(), Error> { /* data validation logic */ }
```

In this example:

- All functionality is packed into one file, making it difficult to navigate and locate specific functions.

## What can be done instead

Split the code into smaller, purpose-specific modules to improve organization and readability:

```rust
// lib.rs (main module file)
mod transaction;
mod fees;
mod validation;

// transaction.rs
pub fn process_transaction() -> Result<Transaction, Error> { /* transaction processing logic */ }

// fees.rs
pub fn calculate_fees() -> u32 { /* fee calculation logic */ }

// validation.rs
pub fn validate_data() -> Result<(), Error> { /* data validation logic */ }
```

In this modularized structure:

- Each module (`transaction.rs`, `fees.rs`, `validation.rs`) contains related functions, making the codebase more
  organized and easier to navigate.
- Developers can work on specific modules without wading through unrelated code, enhancing maintainability and team
  collaboration.
