# Update Dependencies to Avoid Security and Compatibility Issues

**Severity**: High

## Description

Using outdated libraries can introduce security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, and reduced performance, as older
dependencies may lack recent bug fixes and security patches.

## What Should Not Be Done

The following code relies on an outdated library that may contain deprecated or insecure functions:

```rust
use outdated_library::deprecated_fn;
```

## What can be done instead

Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions, ensuring the use of secure and well-maintained functions:

```rust
use latest_library::safe_fn;
```

By updating to the latest versions, you benefit from security improvements, performance enhancements, and better
compatibility, ensuring a more robust and secure application.
