# Benchmark Coverage for Worst-Case Scenarios

**Severity**: High

## Description
Without benchmarks for worst-case scenarios, execution weights may be underestimated.

## Why It Should Not Be Done

The following code demonstrates a poor practice that can lead to issues:

```rust
#[bench] fn typical_scenario() { /* typical path */ }
```

In this example:
- Explain the potential issue or lack of protection mechanisms.

## What Can Be Done Instead

An improved version is shown below:

```rust
#[bench] fn worst_case_scenario() { /* cover worst path */ }
```

Explanation:
- Detail how the changes provide safeguards or improvements.
