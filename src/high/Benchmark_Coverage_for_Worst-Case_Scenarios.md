# Benchmark Worst-Case Scenarios to Ensure Accurate Execution Weights

**Severity**: High

## Description

Benchmarks that only cover typical scenarios may underestimate execution weights, potentially leading to resource
overuse or transaction failures in real-world usage.

## What Should Not Be Done

The following code benchmarks a typical scenario, which may not account for the heaviest possible execution path,
leading to underestimated weights:

```rust
#[benchmark]
fn typical_scenario() {
    let items = generate_data(10); // Benchmark with a small data set
    process_items(items);
}
```

In this example:

- The benchmark uses a small data set (`10` items), which may not reflect the workload in a worst-case scenario.

## What can be done instead

Benchmark the worst-case path by simulating the heaviest possible workload, ensuring the calculated weight accurately
reflects maximum resource usage:

```rust
#[benchmark]
fn worst_case_scenario(s: Linear<1, MAX_ITEMS>) {
    let items = generate_data(s); // Benchmark with maximum data
    process_items(items);
}
```

In this improved example:

- `generate_data(s)` creates the maximum allowed data set to simulate a heavy load.
- By covering the worst-case path, this benchmark provides a realistic weight that prevents unexpected performance
  issues during peak loads.
