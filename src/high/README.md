# High Severity Issues

## Description

High-severity issues are serious problems that, while not immediately threatening the system's stability, pose a significant risk to its operation. In the context of Substrate runtime development, these issues can disrupt key functionalities, create vulnerabilities, or degrade performance over time. Unlike critical issues that can cause immediate chain halts or data corruption, high-severity issues tend to manifest gradually but can still severely impact the network if left unresolved.

## Implications

Unresolved high-severity issues can lead to persistent operational inefficiencies or even chain stalls under certain conditions, especially if they affect essential runtime logic such as storage management or resource-heavy calculations. These issues increase the likelihood of security exploits and degrade the user experience, potentially eroding trust in the network. High-severity issues should be addressed with urgency, as their prolonged existence could escalate into critical problems, threatening the networkâ€™s performance and reliability.
