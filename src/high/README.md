# Critical severity issues

## Description

High-severity issues are serious but not as immediately threatening as critical ones. They often involve security vulnerabilities, significant performance inefficiencies, or non-trivial functional errors. While they may not lead to immediate system failure, high-severity issues have the potential to degrade system performance or expose the application to potential exploits.

## Implications

Unresolved high-severity issues can lead to operational inefficiencies, intermittent failures, or an increased risk of security exploits. These issues should be prioritized just below critical issues and resolved as soon as feasible, as they can hinder system performance and overall user experience in substantial ways.
