# Implement Economic Incentives for Task Verification

**Severity**: Critical

## Description

Without proper incentives, verifiers may lack the motivation to perform accurate validations, which can lead to
unreliable results and affect overall system integrity.

## What should not be done

The following code allows verifiers to decide without any rewards or penalties, which may reduce the accuracy of
verifications:

```rust
fn verify_task(task_id: u32) -> bool {
    // Verification without incentive
     reward_verifier(); // Rewarded regardless of the accuracy
}
```

## What Can Be Done Instead

Introduce economic incentives to reward correct verifications and penalize incorrect ones. This approach motivates
verifiers to act reliably and increases the accuracy of task validation.

```rust
fn verify_task_with_incentive(task_id: u32) -> Result<bool, DispatchError> {
    // Reward or penalize based on verification accuracy
    if is_correct_verification(task_id) {
        reward_verifier(); // Reward for correct verification
    } else {
        penalize_verifier(); // Penalty for incorrect verification
    }
    Ok(true)
}
```

This incentivized approach aligns verifiers' actions with system goals, enhancing reliability and system integrity.
