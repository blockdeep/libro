# Critical Severity Issues

## Description

Critical issues represent the most severe vulnerabilities or performance concerns in a codebase. They can lead to
catastrophic failures, significant security breaches, data loss, or system outages if left unaddressed. Critical issues
may affect core functionalities, leading to a complete breakdown of system integrity or operational stability.

## Implications

Failure to resolve critical issues can expose the system to significant risks, including malicious attacks, data
corruption, or denial of service. In production environments, these issues can cause irreparable harm to system
reliability and user trust. Critical issues demand immediate attention and should be prioritized for resolution above
all other issues.
