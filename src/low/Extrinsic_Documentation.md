# Provide Comprehensive Documentation for Extrinsics

**Severity**: Low

## Description

Extrinsics without proper documentation can lead to confusion about their functionality, parameters, and expected
outcomes, making it harder for users and developers to understand their purpose and usage.

## What Should Not Be Done

An extrinsic without documentation leaves its behavior unclear, as shown below:

```rust
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
pub fn transfer() {
    // Transfers assets, but lacks explanation of parameters or behavior
}
```

In this example:

- The `transfer` function lacks any description, making it difficult to understand how to use it or what parameters it
  expects.

## What Can Be Done Instead

Provide detailed documentation for each extrinsic, describing its purpose, parameters, and expected outcomes to improve
clarity and usability.

```rust
/// Transfers assets from the sender to the recipient.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `sender`: The account ID of the entity sending the assets.
/// - `recipient`: The account ID of the entity receiving the assets.
/// - `amount`: The quantity of assets to be transferred.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns an error if the sender has insufficient funds.
#[pallet::call_index(0)]
#[pallet::weight(T::WeightInfo::transfer())]
pub fn transfer(sender: AccountId, recipient: AccountId, amount: u32) -> DispatchResult {
    // Function implementation here
}
```

By documenting each extrinsic, you ensure users and developers understand its functionality and parameters, reducing the
risk of misinterpretation and errors.
