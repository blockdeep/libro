# Use Consistent and Descriptive Naming Conventions to Enhance Readability

**Severity**: Low

## Description

Inconsistent or vague naming conventions can make code harder to read and understand, slowing down development and
increasing the likelihood of errors. Clear and consistent naming improves code readability and helps maintain a
well-organized codebase.

## What Should Not Be Done

Vague or inconsistent naming conventions make it unclear what a function or variable is supposed to do:

```rust
fn processData() {
    // Function name lacks specificity
}
```

In this example:

- The function name `processData` is too generic, making it difficult for readers to understand its purpose without
  further inspection.

## What can be done instead

Use clear and descriptive names that convey the functionâ€™s purpose and follow a consistent naming style:

```rust
fn process_transaction_data() {
    // Descriptive function name specifies that it processes transaction data
}
```

This approach helps improve readability and consistency across the codebase, making it easier for developers to
understand and maintain the code.
