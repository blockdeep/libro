# Naming Conventions and Code Readability

**Severity**: Low

## Description

Inconsistent naming conventions reduce code readability.

## Why It Should Not Be Done

```rust
fn processData() { /* vague name */ }
```

## What Can Be Done Instead

Adopt consistent, descriptive naming conventions for commonly used structs and types.

```rust
fn process_transaction_data() { /* descriptive name */ }
```
