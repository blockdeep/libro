# Use Appropriate Naming Conventions

**Severity**: <span style="color:green;">Low</span>

## Description

Inconsistent or vague naming conventions can make code harder to read and understand, slowing down development and
increasing the likelihood of errors. Clear and consistent naming improves code readability and helps maintain a
well-organized codebase.

## What should be avoided

Vague or inconsistent naming conventions make it unclear what a function, variable, or type is supposed to do. Here are
several examples of poor naming practices:

### Functions

```rust
fn processData() {
    // Function name lacks specificity
    // Also, it does not follow the snake-case naming convention
}

fn doStuff() {
    // Function name is too generic
}
```

### Variables

```rust
// Variable name 'x' does not convey its purpose
let x = 10;

// 'tmp' is not descriptive of its role
let tmp = calculate_total();
```

### Types

```rust
// The type alias 'B' provides no clarity about its purpose
type B = u32;

// Struct and field names lack descriptive context
struct Info {
    count: u32,
    extra_data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

In these examples:

- The function names `processData` and `doStuff` are too vague, providing no insight into their purpose.
- The variable names `x` and `tmp` do not describe the data they hold, making the code harder to follow.
- The type alias `T` and struct `Info` lack meaningful context, obscuring their intent.

## Best practice

Use clear and descriptive names that convey the purpose and role of each function, variable, or type, and follow
consistent naming styles:

### Functions

```rust
fn process_transaction_data() {
    // Descriptive function name specifies that it processes transaction data
}

fn calculate_user_balance() {
    // Descriptive name clearly conveys the function's purpose
}
```

### Variables

```rust
// Variable name 'total_price' indicates its role in the calculation
let total_price = 10;

// Descriptive variable name reflects its purpose
let updated_balance = calculate_total();
```

### Types

```rust
// Provides context that the alias represents a user's balance
type AccountBalance = u32;

// Meaningful struct and field names improve clarity
struct UserDetails {
    age: u32,
    email: Vec<u8>,
}
```

This approach helps improve readability and consistency across the codebase, making it easier for developers to
understand and maintain the code.
