# Remove Unused Code

**Severity**: <span style="color:green;">Low</span>

## Description

Unused code can clutter a codebase, making it more difficult to read, maintain, and optimize.

## What should be avoided

Avoid leaving behind unused functions, variables, or code comments that are no longer necessary. These elements can lead to confusion and make the code harder to follow, especially as projects grow in size. Consider the example below:

```rust
// Example of unused code in a function

/* fn process_important_data() {
    // some logic that is no longer needed
} */

fn process_data(data: &Vec<u32>) {
    // Unused variable that adds no value
    // let important_variable = data[0];

    // Unused function that is commented out
    // process_important_data();

    let important_variable = 1 * 2; // Only this line is necessary
    ...
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example:

- The process_important_data function is commented out and no longer needed but has not been removed.
- The important_variable initialized with data[0] is also commented out and unnecessary.

## Best practice

To keep the codebase clean and efficient, remove unused or redundant elements like unused functions and variables. The streamlined version of the example above is more readable and maintainable:

```rust
fn process_data(data: &Vec<u32>) {
    let important_variable = 1 * 2; // Essential calculation used in function
    ...
    Ok(())
}
```
