# Unused Code and Redundant Cloning

**Severity**: Low

## Description

Unused code and redundant cloning increase code size and reduce efficiency, leading to unnecessary memory usage and
processing overhead. Removing unused code and minimizing cloning helps maintain a cleaner, more efficient codebase.

## What should not be done

Cloning data unnecessarily creates additional memory allocations, as shown here:

```rust
fn process_data(data: &Vec<u32>) {
    // Cloning the entire vector unnecessarily
    let cloned_data = data.clone();
    
    for elem in cloned_data {
        // processing the element
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The entire `data` vector is cloned, doubling the memory usage even if the original data can be processed directly or
  accessed via reference.

## What can be done instead

Use references to avoid unnecessary cloning, and review code for unused or redundant sections regularly to keep the
codebase lean:

```rust
fn process_data(data: &Vec<u32>) {
    // Process data directly via reference without cloning
    for elem in data {
        // elem is a reference here
    }
}
```

This approach eliminates the need for additional memory allocation, making the code more efficient and easier to
maintain. By using references, you reduce both memory usage and potential performance overhead.
