# Low Severity Issues

## Description

Low-severity issues in Substrate development are generally minor concerns that do not compromise the core functionality or security of the blockchain. These issues often relate to inefficiencies, inconsistent naming conventions, or areas where readability can be improved. While they are not critical, addressing these issues ensures the code remains clean, maintainable, and easy to understand. Resolving low-severity issues can enhance developer productivity, improve the quality of the codebase, and contribute to smoother long-term development and collaboration.

## Implications

Although low-severity issues do not have an immediate impact on the system, addressing them during regular refactoring or maintenance helps prevent code clutter from accumulating. Over time, resolving these issues contributes to a more efficient, readable, and maintainable codebase, improving developer experience and overall project sustainability.
