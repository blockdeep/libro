# Low Severity Issues

## Description

Low-severity issues are minor concerns that generally do not affect the core functionality or security of the system.
These issues might include minor inefficiencies, naming inconsistencies, or slight readability improvements. They are
often cosmetic or stylistic in nature.

## Implications

Low-severity issues have a minimal impact on the application and can often be addressed during regular code refactoring
or maintenance. While they are not immediately pressing, resolving low-severity issues can improve the overall quality
and readability of the codebase, making it easier for developers to work with over time.
