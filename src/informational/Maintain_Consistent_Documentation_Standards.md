# Maintain Consistent Documentation Standards

**Severity**: <span style="color:cyan;">Informational</span>

## Description

Inconsistent documentation across modules can create knowledge gaps, making code harder to understand, maintain, and use
correctly, especially for new contributors.

## What should be avoided

Lack of documentation or minimal comments can leave important details unclear, as shown below:

```rust
fn process_data(data: u32) -> u32 {
  // ...
}
```

In this example:

- The function lacks a description of its purpose, parameters, and potential side effects, making it difficult for
  others to understand, use or modify it confidently.

## Best practice

Establish a consistent documentation standard that includes detailed descriptions, parameter explanations, and expected
outcomes for each function.

```rust
/// Processes the provided data by performing necessary calculations.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `data`: The input data to be processed, expected as an unsigned integer.
///
/// # Returns
/// - Result of the processing operation as a `u32`.
fn process_data(data: u32) -> u32 {
    // Function logic here
    // ...
}
```

With a standardized documentation format, each function is clearly explained, making the codebase easier to understand
and maintain. This approach reduces the risk of misinterpretation and supports team collaboration.
