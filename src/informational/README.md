# Informational Issues

## Description

Informational issues in the context of Substrate development are observations or recommendations that do not directly impact the functionality, security, or performance of the runtime. These issues are usually related to best practices, such as naming conventions, documentation standards, or suggestions to enhance clarity for developers. While not urgent, addressing these informational issues helps improve the overall structure, maintainability, and readability of the codebase, making it more accessible for current and future contributors.

## Implications

Though informational issues do not have immediate technical consequences, resolving them contributes to a cleaner, more organized codebase. By following these recommendations, developers can ensure better documentation, promote adherence to best practices, and facilitate collaboration within the ecosystem, ultimately improving the quality and sustainability of the project over time.
