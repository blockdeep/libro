# Critical severity issues

## Description

Informational issues are observations or recommendations that do not affect the functionality, security, or performance of the code. These may include suggestions for best practices, documentation improvements, or reminders to enhance developer understanding. Informational issues are typically non-urgent.

## Implications

Informational issues can enhance developer knowledge, improve documentation, and support adherence to best practices. Although not critical, addressing these issues can contribute to the overall quality of the codebase, making it more robust, maintainable, and accessible to future developers.
