# Maintain Consistent Documentation Standards Across Modules

**Severity**: Informational

## Description

Inconsistent documentation across modules can create knowledge gaps, making code harder to understand, maintain, and use
correctly, especially for new contributors.

## What Should Not Be Done

Lack of documentation or minimal comments can leave important details unclear, as shown below:

```rust
// No documentation for this function
fn process_data(data: u32) {
    // Function logic here
}
```

In this example:

- The function lacks a description of its purpose, parameters, and potential side effects, making it difficult for
  others to use or modify it confidently.

## What can be done instead

Establish a consistent documentation standard that includes detailed descriptions, parameter explanations, and expected
outcomes for each function.

```rust
/// Processes the provided data by performing necessary calculations.
/// 
/// # Parameters
/// - `data`: The input data to be processed, expected as an unsigned integer.
/// 
/// # Returns
/// - Result of the processing operation as a `u32`.
fn process_data(data: u32) -> u32 {
    // Function logic here
}
```

With a standardized documentation format, each function is clearly explained, making the codebase easier to understand
and maintain. This approach reduces the risk of misinterpretation and supports team collaboration.
